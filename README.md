## :memo: Project Description
This artwork is a visual analysis of the [London Stage Database](https://londonstagedatabase.uoregon.edu/data.php). It explores the top 5 performances in London measured in number of shows from 1700 to 1800, where these performances took place most frequently, and the top performers in each play. I analyzed the data using Python, drafted some initial charts on RAWGraphs, and worked on the overall look of the visualization in Adobe Illustrator. This visualization was submitted to the Nightingale as part of the [Data is Plural Challenge](https://nightingaledvs.com/data-is-plural-visualization-challenge/).
